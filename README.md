# Programming-Challenges

This repository includes the implementation for the problem set of the book "Programming Challenges: The Programming Contest Training Manual" by Steven S. Skiena and Miguel A. Revilla.

The codes only provide some hints for readers to come up with their own ideas. There is no guarantee the code will be working. Readers should use the codes at their own risk.
